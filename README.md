# HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Learning what HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript are can be rather confusing at first. Which is where this wonderful study guide comes in to help reinforce what we as boot camp students have learned thus far. We can call upon this study guide if there is something that we arnet 100% sure of or just want a quick refresher on some useful information. During the creation of this project I learned the very important fundamentals of coding which include HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Hopefuly, with access to this study guide you can also learn about them too or just use it as a review!

## Usage

Using this HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript study guide requires you to look under each individual section for a bullet point list of information. To make your studying experience even better it also requires using Chrome DevTools (Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) and opening up the console. In the console you will see a list of all 4 topics that we learned throughout the boot camp prework and also a topic randomizer that tells you what to study first at each refresh of the page.
