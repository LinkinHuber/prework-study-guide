      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</li>
         <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
         <li>The "head" element contains information about the webpage.</li>
         <li>The "charset" element sets our character encoding.</li>
         <li>The "http-equiv" element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
         <li>The "viewport" element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
         <li>The "body" element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
         <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
         <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
         <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
         <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
         <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
         <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

     <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of the element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
        <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
        <li>Internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
        <li>A "link" element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
      </ul>

     <section class="card" id="git-section">
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“ls” allows us to see a list of files and directories on our computer.</li>
        <li>“cd” this command allows us to change directories.</li>
        <li>“pwd” which is short for "print working directory," will print out the directory that we are currently in to the terminal.</li>
        <li>“cd ___“ is how you navigate between directories.</li> 
        <li>“cd ..” allows us to navigate backwards one directory at a time.</li>
        <li>“mkdir” is the command used to create a new directory.</li>
        <li>“touch ___-___.txt” is how to name the file.</li> 
        <li>“start ___-___.txt” is how you open the new file.</li>
        <li>"git status" checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
        <li>"git checkout -b branch-name" creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
        <li>"git ckeckout branch-name" switches you to that branch.</li>
        <li>"git add -A" used to stage your changes "add -A" commits all files in the working branch.</li>
        <li>"git commit -m "changes you made" commits them to our repository, We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit.</li>
        <li>"git pull origin main" we need to sync our local branch with the remote branch in GitHub, use this to pull in the base branch.</li>
        <li>"git push origin branch-name" used to push up all of our changes.</li>
      </ul>

     <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>Javascript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable "var" is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JavaScript is from top to bottom.</li>
        <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
        <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop, the second statement is the condition, the final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
        <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
        <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. You must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
