      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</li>
         <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
         <li>The "head" element contains information about the webpage.</li>
         <li>The "charset" element sets our character encoding.</li>
         <li>The "http-equiv" element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
         <li>The "viewport" element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
         <li>The "body" element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
         <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
         <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
         <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
         <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>

     <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of the element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
        <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
        <li>Internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
      </ul>
